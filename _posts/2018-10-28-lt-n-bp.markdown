This week was quite busy. On Tuesday my post [_Four things about
Pry_](https://revs.runtime-revolution.com/four-things-about-pry-a0ebb10c6c2e)
was published on my company's [blog](https://revs.runtime-revolution.com/). It
is about some features which I find really useful for debugging Ruby code.

And then on Thursday I made a lightning talk about Lisp. In it I attempt to give
some insight some of Lisp's often joked and praised about features:
- Parenthesis
- Prefix notation
- Recursion
- Functional programming

Had to remove **macros** due to time restrictions. (slides are [here](https://bjacquet.github.io/extras/lisp-speech-therapy/presentation.html))
