Was fascinated to read about the [new visual changes](https://h3manth.com/ES2021/) to Javascript. Some I know them for a long timeâ€”from other languages. Languages are no longer shy from borrowing whatever syntax that looks cool from other languages. Jazz masters do it too so why shouldn't Javascript or Ruby or whatever do it?

I can see the day I'll inadvertently write some Ruby code inside a Javascript file. Every new version they _look_ ever more alike. One day we'll write code following a single unified syntax and then say to the engine _"run this in Elixir"_, or _"run this in Python"_. In a way we do it for a long time. All these languages are just DSLs for binary code.
