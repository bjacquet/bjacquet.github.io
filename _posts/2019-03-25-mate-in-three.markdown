Last week I made my second lightning talk. This one about chess!

I wanted all my puzzles to have three movements, hence the name [_Mate in
Three_](https://bjacquet.github.io/extras/mate-in-three/index.html), but during
the test run there was the impression that three was too much.

Turns out my audience wanted to solve the puzzles whilst I was still trying to explain the rules. Such great students! :-)
