Yesterday I saw [this|monades] post about [tig|tig]. Tig is a
text-mode interface for Git. More goodies for those who don't want to
leave the command line!

Tig is some sort of Git IDE althoug you cannot create a repository
with it. You can neither push or pull. Tig is makes history inspection
quick and easy. I don't find the commit workflow to be very
straightforward.

As for Git IDEs go, [Magit|magit] is still the #1 for me.
