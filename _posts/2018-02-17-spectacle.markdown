After trying out a few window managers (macOS) my _weapon of choice_
was down to two. The [Amethyst](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/), which
I've addressed [previously]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-01-06-xmonad.markdown %}), and the
[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/).

They behave so differently from each other that I favour Amethyst when
I'm in a mood for _mouseless_ experience. Most of the time I use
Spectacle to move windows to one of the sides or center.
