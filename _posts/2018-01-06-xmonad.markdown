On my last months of using Linux at home I began
using [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/). Xmonad is a window manager for
Linux which takes care of the window's position an size making all
windows visible, a tiling window manager. At the time I also
"discovered" Haskell. Xmonad is written in Haskell. :heart_eyes: I was
both curious to use it and supportive for being written in it.

I then switched to OS X and stop using it.

Last week I was searching for a window manager for macOS. Something
resembling Windows 10's, which I use at work, would sufice. I
discovered [Amethyst](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/). Amethyst is a
tiling window manager based on xmonad although not written in Haskell.

## Amethyst Shortcuts

Amethyst has many keyboard shortcuts. These are the ones I use more often:

* `Alt+Shift+K` Next Window
* `Alt+Shift+J` Previous Window

* `Alt+Shift+Ctrl+K` Move Window to Next Position
* `Alt+Shift+Ctrk+J` Move Window to Previous Position

* `Alt+Shift+return` Switch with Main Window

* `Alt+Shift+H` Move Border Left
* `Alt+Shift+L` Move Border Right

* `Alt+Shift+SPC` Cycle Layouts

* `Alt+Shift+,` Add a Window to Left Pane
* `Alt+Shift+.` Add a Window to Right Pane
