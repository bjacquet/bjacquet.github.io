I consider myself an all-rounder programmer with an affection toward (so called) 'strange' languages like Haskell, Lisp, and Rust. I've found at [SISCOG](http://www.siscog.pt/) a place where one can code Lisp all day and still be paid for! SISCOG is probably the biggest employer of Lisp programmers. ðŸ¤˜ I'm also introducing Git, GitLab, Gerrit, and Slack into our workflows. ðŸ¤Ÿ

Recently started contributing to [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) by translating their products into Portuguese.
