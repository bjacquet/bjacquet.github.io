???
Hard to pinpoint when Lisp was created. 1958~1962

In 1960 John McCarthy released paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I".

There, he showed that with a few simple operators and a notation for functions, one can build a Turing-complete language for algorithms.

Turing-complete: which can simulate a Turing machine.

Most likely when referring to 'Lisp' one is referring to 'Common Lisp'.

# Parenthesis Everywhere

```lisp
(defun birthday-paradox (probability people)
  (let ((new-probability (* (/ (- +year-size+ people)
                               +year-size+)
                            probability)))
    (if (< new-probability 0.5)
        (1+ people)
        (birthday-paradox new-probability (1+ people)))))
```

```lisp
λ (list 1 "b" 'c #'+)
(1 "b" c +)
```

* Expression delimiters

* Represent data as lists

???
Parenthesis are the only delimiters.

Newcomers have a hard counting them.

Old-timers follow the flow by indentation.

"In my time" Lisp was taught in pen-n-paper!

One had to keep track of open '('

Although important, it push the student away from the language.

---

# Delimiters Ruby

```ruby
def permutation(l = [])
  for e in 1..6
    a, i = [], e-2
    (0..l.length-e+1).each do |g|
       if not (n = l[g..g+e-2]).uniq!
         a.concat(n[(a[0]? i : 0)..-1]).push(e).concat(n)
         i = e-2
       else
         i -= 1
       end
     end
     a.each { |n| print n }; puts "\n\n"
     l = a
  end
end
```

???
def end for function block

() for function arguments

, to separate arguments

in/do end for iteration block

{} for iteration block (alternative)

[] for array accessor

. to call instance class function

# Prefix Notation

![frame](assets/images/frame.jpg)

???
Devs joke that you have to put every command upfront.

--

```lisp
(if (< new-probability 0.5)
    (setq people (+ people 1))
    (birthday-paradox new-probability (1+ people))))
```

???
It actually looks good for if conditionals.

But not so much on lesser-then.

Overall, is no different from calling functions all the time.

# Recursion

???
Some devs talk about recursion as if only some languages have it.

---

# Recursion

```lisp
(defun factorial (n)
  (factorial-aux n 1))

(defun factorial-aux (n a)
  (if (= n 1)
      a
      (factorial-aux (- n 1) (* n a))))
```

???
Recursion is not exclusive to Lisp

Every language has it.

---

# Recursion

```ruby
def factorial(n)
  factorial_aux(n, 1)
end

def factorial-aux(n, a)
  n == 1 ? a : factorial_aux(n - 1, n * a)
end
```

???
Could it be that other languages aren't as optimized as Lisp for tail recursion?

--

```ruby
def factorial(n)
  return 1 if n == 0
  (1..n).inject(:*)
end
```

???
A more rubyist way of doing it.

---

# Functional Programming
## Higher-order functions
## Purity
## Recursion

???
There is a hype on Functional Programming.

And devs tend to associate Lisp with it.

--

### Lisp has these features and so does Ruby
### Yet neither are considered _pure_ functional

???

- functions are passed as arguments to other functions or returned as results.
- functions without side effects, don't change the state.
- same input return same output.
- functions that call themselves.

Not pure because they have mutable variables.

---

# Functional Programming

```lisp
(defun look ()
  (append (describe-location *location* *map*)
          (describe-paths *location* *map*)
          (describe-floor *location* *objects* *object-locations*)))
```

--

.center[![functional](assets/images/functional.jpg)]

???
Function with side effects, increments `counter` in the background.
`counter` is actually *15*.
